With Princess, you have three options for usage:

1. The entire library.
2. Individual modules with preset styles.
3. Individual mixins. *experimental; use at your own risk*

All options allow for easy customization and are built on top of the Normalize library.

*To read more about customization, go here: [Customizations]({% post_url 2014-03-01-customizations %})*

## Downloading

To download Princess, clone the repository from Git or grab the zip.

Select the files you want to use (see below for more on this) and store them in your `css` folder.

## Full library

You only have to require one file for the full Princess library.

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/princess.css">
{% endhighlight %}

This will include Normalize along with the base stylings for Princess and all of its modules.

## Individual modules

Princess is comprised of numerous modules that rely on mixins. The modules have preset styles to them that all work together in a very lovely aesthetically pleasing manner.

For more information on using the individual modules, see here.

## Individual mixins

If you desire total control of your styles, you can opt to use the mixins on an individual basis. Documentation for mixins is included with the relevant modules (ex: transition mixins are included with the transition module documentation).
