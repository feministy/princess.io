With Princess, you have two options for usage:

1. The entire library.
2. Individual modules.

Both allow for easy customization and require you to include the Normalize library.

Select the files you want to use (see below) and store them in your `css` folder.

## Full library

You only have to require two files for the full Princess library.

If you've done any customizations to the variables, colors, or inside of `custom.scss`, these will be included.
