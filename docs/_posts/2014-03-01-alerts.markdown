This module includes classes for inline and block alerts. Colors come from the `$alert` variable (and its light/dark companions).

## Inline alert

<span class="prncs-alert-inline">Alert alert!</span> That is some important stuff.

{% highlight html %}
<span class="prncs-alert-inline">Alert alert!</span> That is some important stuff.
{% endhighlight %}

## Inline alert alternative

<span class="prncs-alert">Alert alert!</span> That is some important stuff.

{% highlight html %}
<span class="prncs-alert">Alert alert!</span> That is some important stuff.
{% endhighlight %}

## Block alert

This alert doesn't play nicely with heading elements due to the padding.

This will turn any element into a block element. If it's already a block element, that's fine.

<span class="prncs-alert-block">Alert alert!</span>

{% highlight html %}
<span class="prncs-alert-block">Alert alert!</span>
{% endhighlight %}
